# Financial Document Automation Project

Welcome to the Financial Document Automation Project by **FIRM-AI**, a collaborative effort between data science students from ESPRIT and BFI GROUP company. Our team of five is dedicated to automating the processing and analysis of financial documents, leveraging the latest advancements in data science and machine learning.

## Team Members

- Emna FAZAA (Group Manager)
- Mehdi FATHALLAH (Project Leader)
- Iness ELAHCHAICHI (Team Leader)
- Montassar MAIZA (Data scientist)
- Rima BACHA (Data scientist)

## Collaborators

- **ESPRIT** - Educational Institution providing guidance and knowledge support.
- **BFI GROUP** - Industry partner contributing domain expertise and resources.

## Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the handling of financial papers, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, using automated optical character recognition (OCR) and document classification techniques. Our solution intends to reduce manual data entry errors, improve processing times, and enable more efficient analysis of financial data.

## Key Features

- **Document Classification:** Automatically classify various types of financial documents.
- **Text Extraction:** Use OCR to extract text from scanned documents and PDFs.
- **Data Analysis:** Implement algorithms to analyze extracted data for insights.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate extracted data into existing financial systems.

## Technologies Used

- Python for scripting and automation.
- Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition.
- Poppler for PDF processing.
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for document classification.
